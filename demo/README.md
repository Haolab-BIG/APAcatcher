This directory contains example data for testing purposes.  
All files are provided in simplified form and are not intended for biological interpretation.  

Files included:  

1. **sample1.bam**, **sample2.bam**, **sample3.bam**  
   - BAM files containing reads aligned to a limited set of genes:  
     *PRICKLE1, NUP107, SUPT6H, PROCA1, NUDT21, and CDC6*.  
   - These subsets are provided solely to facilitate testing and demonstration, and do not represent complete transcriptome data.  

2. **RefSeq_UTR_final.bed**  
   - BED file containing only the annotated 3′ untranslated regions (3′UTRs) from RefSeq transcripts.   

3. **RefSeq_UTR_lastexon_final.bed**  
   - BED file including both the last annotated exon and the corresponding 3′UTR for each RefSeq transcript.  

All files are minimal examples provided for pipeline testing.
